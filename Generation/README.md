# Generation data
This folder contains several tables with data related to the power plants of Mexico's electricity grid. 
It includes several python scripts with different functions:
+ **Costs Asignation:**  Python script that assignes several costs (operation and manatainence and overnight) to the list of power plants using data from COPAR. To see more details of this script, consult the "Costs asignation description" document in the "reports" directory.
+ **Tech costs comparison:**  Graphic comparison of the costs per generation technology between the method used in "Costs Asignation" script and Sergio's method. For a better view of the plots generated by this script, we recommend to see the jupyter notebook version. 
+ **generator info creation:**  Creation of a table related to generation technologies. This script creates the "data/generation_info_trial.tab" that is used as base for the "data/generation_info.tab" table. For more details regarding the sources of the information contained in "data/generation_info.tab", consult the "generator_info creation" documnet in the "reports" directory
