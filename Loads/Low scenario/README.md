This are scripts that Analyze the hourly demand of electricity in every region of the SEN (Sistema energético nacional)

The "Table creation" script creates the "demand per node.csv" and "highlights per node.csv" files. As you can see, these files are already in the repository, so this scripts doesn´t need to be runed. I have put them here so you can check out how were these files created.

The "Graphical analysis" script prints graphics that show important data regarding of the hourly demand projections. The firs part of the script prints a graphic for each node of the SEN of the average daily demand for every year until 2030. Second part of the script receives an input of a node, year and month. After that, it prints a graphic of the average daily demand of that year and month in that node, and the hourly demand for 4 days: the highest-average demand day, the average-closest day to the daily average of demand that month, the median-average day  and a random day.
