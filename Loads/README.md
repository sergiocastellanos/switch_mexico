#Loads data and analysis
The following folder contains data tables and scripts related to the daily load of Mexico's electricity grid. Each folder represents a different scenario for the load: high, low and medium. For a detailed description of the information contained, check the readme file of each folder

As the Loads are presented hourly, we must mention that all of the times are refered to Mexico's capital timezone, UTC-6

All of the python scripts here are presented in 2 versions:

*A normal .py python script

*A .ipynb jupyter notebook python script. This script can only be visualized in a jupyter notebook server or the jupyter notebook viewer.

For further reference of the Jupyter Notebook, check http://jupyter.org/

For a detailed description of the folders of load projection scenarios, consult the "loads projections report" document.

The "Timepoints and timeseries creation" script creates time-related SWITCH input tables. For a detailed description of this document, consult the "timeseries and timepoints report" document.
