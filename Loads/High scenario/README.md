This are scripts that Analyze the hourly load of electricity in every region of the SEN (Sistema energ�tico nacional). All of the load values of the tables are in units of MWh/h, or (MW), as average power for the hour.

The "Table creation" script creates the "HourlyLoadPerNode.csv" and "LoadHighlightsPerNode.csv" files. As you can see, these files are already in the repository, so this scripts doesn�t need to be runed. I have put them here so you can check out how were these files created.

The "Graphical analysis" script prints graphics that show important data regarding of the hourly load projections. The firs part of the script prints a graphic for each node of the SEN of the average daily load for every year until 2030. Second part of the script receives an input of a node, year and month. After that, it prints a graphic of the average daily load of that year and month in that node, and the hourly load for 4 days: the highest-average load day, the average-closest day to the daily average of load that month, the median-average day  and a random day.
