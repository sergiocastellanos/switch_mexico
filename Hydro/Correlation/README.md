# Correlation

This folder contains data that aims to expose the correlation between the climate events and the Net Generation of each hydro station.

All the data were extracted from National Water Commission in Mexico, known in Spanish as [CONAGUA][conagua]

The "Production-Drought-Precipitation" folder contains a .csv file per hydro station with the aforementioned values.
  - The files are classified by state.

The "correlation.py" script creates the "correlationResults.csv" file. It also produces scatter plots that may show whether there is a link between those variables or not.

In order to see the scatter plots you must type on command line:
```sh
$ python correlation.py [state] [hydro station name]
```
(You will be able to consult all available hydro stations on "[Data/Production-Drought-Precipitation][data]/[state]/[hydroStationName.csv]")


The "CorrelationResults" folder contains a '.csv' file with the correlation coefficients.
  - Each row contains the name of a hydro station, the state to which it belongs, and the correlation coefficients for both the "Production-Drought" and "Production-Precipitation".
